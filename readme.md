Allows you to compose content in Markdown on a per-item basis. The markdown version is stored separately, so you can deactivate this plugin any time.

## Description ##

This plugin allows you to compose content in Markdown on a per-item basis. The markdown version is stored separately (in the `post_content_filtered` column), so you can deactivate this plugin and your posts won't spew out Markdown, because HTML is stored in the `post_content`, just like normal. This is also much faster than doing on-the-fly Markdown conversion on every page load. It's only done once! When you re-edit the post, the markdown version is swapped into the editor for you to edit. If something external updates the post content, you'll lose the Markdown version.

## Installation ##

1. Upload the `markdown-on-save` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

2. Activate the "Markdown On Save" plugin in your WordPress administration interface

3. Create a new post with Markdown, and check the "This post is formatted with Markdown" box.

4. Done! Now that post can be edited using Markdown, but will save as processed HTML on the backend.

## Screenshots ##

1. The meta box where you designate a post as containing Markdown. This is the only UI for the plugin!

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### How do I use Markdown syntax? ###

Please refer to this resource: [http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/](PHP Markdown Extra).

### What happens if I uncheck the Markdown box? ###

Your post will no longer be interpreted as Markdown, and you may have to alter the post to remove Markdown formatting.

### What happens if I decide I don't want this plugin anymore? ###

Just deactivate it. The Markdown version is stored separately, so without the plugin, you'll just revert to editing the HTML version.
